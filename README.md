# 1TutorialPerDay

## Summary

This repository intends to "capture" many Youtube tutorials.

The main idea here is to train technologies, techniques, how each dev implements and organize the code.

## Usecase

As a software engineer, I need to learn, learn, and learn ALWAYS. 

This repo should be used to collect all those "micro-learnings" of my day-by-day and to share this knowledge.

## Expected Technologies - Main

  - NodeJS
  - ReactJS

  - [Nx](https://nx.app/)
- React :: Redux-Saga
- React :: Context-API
- NextJS :: State Management (Redux?)
- NodeJS :: Web Workers
- NodeJS :: Native Modules
  - Native Modulues written in Rust using [NEON](https://neon-bindings.com/)
- NodeJS :: WebSockets (not socket.io =P)
- NodeJS :: Streams
## Expected Techniques

- DDD :: Domain-Driven Design
- TDD :: Test-Driven Development
- S.O.L.I.D
